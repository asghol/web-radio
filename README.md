# web-radio

> A simple radio player

The initial intention with this project was to try out Vue.js and check out its capabilities. When playback got possible I saw that this could also be useful on road trips or for daily use in general. I do not have a DAB radio in my car and can save the expense (for now) by streaming the low quality option.

If you are not interested in running the project yourself and want to listen to Norwegian radio stations, feel free to go to the hosted version [here](http://radio.equalsnull.com/).

## Code quality disclaimer
This was not an attempt to create maintainable code. I have tried to keep things simple for my own sake but this is a playground project developed after my kids' bedtime. Be advised.
